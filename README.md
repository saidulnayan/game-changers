Hello, We are team Game Changers.

The world is getting modernized, but not all the people in it are being benefited. 14% of the world's population is illiterate, and 10% lives in extreme poverty. One third of the food is wasted, while many people starve for days. To solve this imbalance we created an intermediary online platform to connect people who need support can get from the people who are willing to provide.

This platform can be accessed from anywhere globally. The nearby registered people will get a notification to reach their support to the needy person. The help providers don't need to go physically every time. They can buy the needy persons a purchase card from nearby super shops within this platform and when the needy persons go to that specific shop they can get what they needed.

The network of help providers will consist of doctors to provide telemedicine, grocery stores, and restaurants to provide food, an integrated ATM system to provide money, or any kind of person to provide help or support.

Live location sharing, video calls, reviews, and unique ID systems will make sure the right person is getting or providing the support. With the help of this interactive platform, we can resolve the top 4 goals of SDG: no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and education.
